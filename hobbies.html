				<h3> My hobbies are...</h3>
			
			<p> &hearts; Music </p>
			<p> I am always closely interested in music. Singing songs, listening to music, playing an instrument... They are an important part of my life.
			Since elementary school, I join the choirs. Even if my voice isn't good enough, singing makes me feel comfortable and free. I play piano since 9th
			grade. Piano has a special meaning for me. While I am playing the piano, I'm devoting oneself to the music completely and isolated from the world.</p>

			<p> Songs I like to listen recently:</p>
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb1ugGuYVL0"> -> Schumann - Quintette avec piano op. 44 - 2e mouvement</a><br>
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiFk6KHr_8"> -> Nightwish - While Your Lips Are Still Red</a><br>
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpypkvZjJiI"> -> Maroon 5 - One More Night</a><br>
			
			<p> &hearts; Dance </p>
			<p> Dancing is always something interesting for me but I never did it professionally before university. Now I'm taking tango course which is given by 
			DeuDans for 3 months and I learned a lot of things already.</p>

			<p> &hearts; Photography </p>
			<p> My photography curiosity started with the university and Cansel. She wanted to join the photography club, I thought 'maybe I can join, too.
			It can be funny.'. So that I joined, too. We learned the history of photography, how to take the true picture, photo-bath in the darkroom. It is
			an enjoyable activity to spend time and have fun.</p>

			<p> &hearts; Books and Moives </p>
			<p> I love reading book and watching movie, if they ask 'How do you spend your time?', I answer 'I want to read book and watch movie for the rest of
			my life.' (of course with the music on background). I have my own library in my room at home, there are different kinds of books like Agatha Christie
			and Julie Garwood. Crime, romance, fantastic, classic novels. About watching movie, it's a family tradition for us. For example, if there is Agatha
			Christie's movie on tv, we watch it all together and try to guess who's the murderer. We watch horror movies, my older sister and I fear everytime but
			we still watch it. </p>
